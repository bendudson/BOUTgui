# GUI-for-SOL1D
This program is designed to work along side the SOL1D simulation code written by Ben Dudson to act as a graphical interface between the user and the workings behind the scenes. It should contain within it all the features the user could need - input file editing, simualation runs and finally output file analysis in the form of graphs. Also a 'scanning' feature is in development to allow a long series of automated simualtions to be run with the program automatically increasing a selected variable. There is also a command line to talk directly to the python shell for more complicated data analysis which the advanced user may prefer to use.
